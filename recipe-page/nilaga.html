            <h2>Nilaga Recipe</h2>
            <p>
                Nilagang Buto-buto ng Baka is something that I make when the weather is cold, and when I have extra time. The hot broth makes me feel warm and comfortable. It has been a comfort food for me every winter. Extra time is needed to prepare this dish because I usually do the traditional way of  tenderizing the meat while extracting most of the flavors from the bone. This involves cooking the bones and meat in low heat for around 2 to 3 hours.
